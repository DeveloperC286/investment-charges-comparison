# Investment-Charges-Comparison

While trying to compare investment options against their various attributes, I needed the capability to calculate and graph the data to help me evaluate my choices.

I was not able to find a program which could achieve this, so I created this Python script to calculate and plot the data. Hopefully, you can also find a use for the script in helping you evaluate your choices!
